## Become a Member or Supporter

We would be thrilled if you can convince your organization to [become a member of e-editiones](how-to-become-a-member). Institutional membership gives our society the best leverage when applying for funding or infrastructural support. If this is difficult in your institution, consider our special Support membership or join the society as an individual.

## Add your project to our registry

We love to hear back from people and organizations who use software or resources curated by e-editiones. Add your project, however large or small, to our registry. We are more than happy to list initiatives already at an early stage of development. Your entry lets us to have awareness of the reaches of our community and demonstrate impact to the funding bodies. It also fosters communication and collaboration between the projects.

## Help with funding

We're happy to join funding bids which relate to the goals of our society or accept partners contributing seed funds to the proposals we make. Need a feature but can't finance it in full? Please get in touch and we'll try to pool resources within our community to make it happen. Last but not least, we have a [Donate](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=ST7PNHJK3FMX8) button and your contributions go into open source development.

## Translations on Crowdin

If you could help us with a new translation or review an existing one, please go to [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/tei-publisher) to make the TEI Publisher even more international. Just one hour of your time can make a huge difference.

## TEI Examples

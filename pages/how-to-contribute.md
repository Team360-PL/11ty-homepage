There are many way how you could support us and contribute:

You can find the source code of the TEI Publisher and many examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/eeditiones)

## Translations on Crowdin

There are already a few translations of the TEI Publisher. If you could create a new translation or review an existing one, please go to [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/tei-publisher) and help us to make the TEI Publisher even more international.

## TEI Examples

To make the TEI Publisher as versatile as possible we are loocking for TEI examples which can be used for development, tests and also for teaching. The collection is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-examples).

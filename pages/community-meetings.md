In April 2021 e-editions have launched a series of regular community meetings that will be held on the first Tuesday of each month at 17:00 CET/CEST.

The objective of these meetings is to give the community a space to discuss topics and present their editions, projects, challenges and solutions.

As for the format, a short presentation of the topic or the project will be followed by an open discussion. Meetings will last one hour.

The community meetings will be held online and will not be recorded: [https://meet.existsolutions.com/eeditiones](https://meet.existsolutions.com/eeditiones)

We warmly invite you to propose topics at [info@e-editiones.org](info@e-editiones.org) for the future community meetings dates.

In April 2021 e-editions will launch a series of regular community meetings that will be held on the first Tuesday of each month at 17:00 CET/CEST.

The objective of these meetings is to give the community a space to discuss topics and present their editions, projects, and solutions.

As for the format, a short presentation (10-20 minutes) of the topic or the project will be followed by an open discussion. Meetings will last one hour.

The community meetings will be held online and will not be recorded: [https://meet.existsolutions.com/eeditiones](https://meet.existsolutions.com/eeditiones)

We warmly invite you to propose topics [info@e-editiones.org](info@e-editiones.org) for the following community meetings dates.

There are two kinds of membership: institutional and personal/individual.

The annual membership fee for institutional members (legal entities) is CHF 500.– (Swiss Francs), while the annual fee for individuals (natural persons) is reduced to CHF 50.–. However, only fully paying members have voting rights.

To become a member please contact the board: [info@e-editiones.org](mailto:info@e-editiones.org)

The board will then propose your membership to the assembly (by email), which has to approve.

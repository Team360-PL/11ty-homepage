In this months meetup we’ll talk about ongoing and planned developments in TEI Publisher. There’s a long list of pending and ongoing activities over which we’ll try to give you an overview. The community is invited to contribute ideas, requests or take part in future joint funding proposals. We’ll reserve sufficient time for discussions, so please join and help shape the future!

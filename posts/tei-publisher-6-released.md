The new TEI Publisher 6.0.0 is finally out!

This is a major release introducing the refactored and extended web components which are now available as a LitElement library distributed via npm. While invisible to users, this redesign greatly improves modularity and simplifies updates of Publisher-based applications. It also facilitates embedding of Publisher custom components into CMS systems (e.g. Hugo or WordPress) and other application frameworks (like angular, vue or react).

Version 6 also brings extended internationalization and full localization into 19 languages, simplified styling, support for data organization based on subcollections, several new and enhanced components (including one for [notated music](https://unpkg.com/@teipublisher/pb-components@1.0.0/dist/api.html#pb-mei.1 "notated music") encoded in MEI), improved ODD editor and major extension and revision of the documentation.

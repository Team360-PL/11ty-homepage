Upcoming community meetup on **Dec. 6, 2022**:

Sometimes you don't need a fully dynamic website with sophisticated search and navigation, but rather a simple service, which is super fast, reliable and easy to maintain. This is where static site generators provide a perfect alternative to a dynamic, database-driven architecture like TEI Publisher. In this session we'll learn how to marry the two concepts to combine the best of both worlds.

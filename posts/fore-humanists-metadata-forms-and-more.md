2021-06-15: For(e) humanists - Metadata, Forms and more

Joern Turner, eXistSolutions and Jinntec GmbH

Fore is a model-driven forms framework that follows the ideas of the XForms 2.0 Standard but translates those into the world of HTML5 Web Components.

Many edition project require some sort of complex input form sooner or later - just think about collecting metadata for the TEI header. The talk will focus on TEI and show you how to author such forms in HTML5.

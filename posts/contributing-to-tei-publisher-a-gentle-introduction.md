Talk by Wolfgang Meier (eXist Solutions) on Tuesday, the 6th of July 2021 at 17:00 CEST.

Open source projects like TEI Publisher depend on an active, contributing community. Many believe that you need to be a programmer to contribute, but this is a misconception! Documentation, communication, supporting users or providing feedback are at least as important for an open source project as thousands of lines of code.

This session targets non-programmers as well as those with some development skills. We'll start with simple things, e.g. contributing to the [FAQ](https://faq.teipublisher.com "FAQ"), and then move on and show you how to create your own little web component to plug into TEI Publisher. We'll use a grid component for displaying tabular data as an example.
